            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                We introduce the MultiLang Code Parser Dataset (MLCPD), a large-scale, language-agnostic dataset
                unifying syntactic and structural representations of code across ten major programming languages. MLCPD
                contains over seven million parsed source files normalized under our proposed universal Abstract Syntax
                Tree (AST) schema, enabling consistent cross-language reasoning, structural learning, and multilingual
                software analysis. Unlike existing corpora that focus purely on token-level code or isolated parsers,
                MLCPD provides both hierarchical tree representations and rich metadata for every file, ensuring
                lossless syntactic coverage and structural uniformity. Each entry includes a normalized schema,
                language-level metadata, and abstracted node semantics stored in Parquet format for scalable retrieval.
                Empirical analyses reveal strong cross-language structural regularities-demonstrating that syntactic
                graphs from languages as diverse as Python, Java, and Go can be aligned under a shared schema. We
                release the dataset publicly on Hugging Face and the accompanying codebase on GitHub, which includes
                complete pipelines for dataset reproduction, grammar compilation, and a visualization tool for exploring
                the unified AST across languages. Together, these resources establish MLCPD as an open, reproducible
                foundation for future research in cross-language representation learning and program analysis.

            <h2>Related Work</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                Prior corpora (The Stack, StarCoder, CodeSearchNet) emphasize token-level data and lack unified
                structural supervision. IRs and parsers offer partial structure but inconsistent semantics across
                languages. MLCPD addresses this gap with a lossless, uniform, and scalable universal AST schema covering
                ten languages.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                MLCPD employs a modular data pipeline built on Tree-sitter grammars to parse and unify code
                across ten major programming languages. The framework performs automated language detection, AST
                extraction, and normalization into a four-layer universal schema that captures syntactic, semantic, and
                structural information. Each parsed file includes metadata, a flat node array, and categorized
                constructs—such as declarations, statements, and expressions—allowing consistent interpretation across
                diverse languages.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                To ensure efficiency and scalability, all processed data undergo schema validation before being
                serialized into the Apache Parquet format. This design supports distributed processing, fast I/O, and
                large-scale query execution for training and analysis. The pipeline also integrates custom validators
                for error handling, achieving a 99.9999% successful conversion rate across 7 million+ code files.

            <h2>Results & Analysis</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                The final MLCPD dataset encompasses 7,021,722 parsed source files across ten languages, occupying
                approximately 114 GB in Parquet format. Statistical analysis reveals consistent structural patterns and
                balanced representation across language families, demonstrating the robustness of the universal AST
                schema. MLCPD enables cross-language reasoning, code similarity search, and structure-aware pretraining
                for LLMs and graph-based models. Its uniform schema and high parsing fidelity make it a foundational
                benchmark for multilingual code understanding and scalable program analysis research.
