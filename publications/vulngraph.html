            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                Software vulnerabilities remain a persistent risk, yet static and dynamic analyses often overlook
                structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors. Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we
                capture control- and data-flow relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines
                these graph representations with light-weight (&lt;4B) local LLMs, uniting topological features with
                semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java
                vulnerability detection (binary classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over
                Graph Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines such as Qwen2.5 Coder
                3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient subgraphs and generates natural language
                explanations, improving interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable,
                explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis from purely syntactic
                checks to deeper structural and semantic insights, facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure
                software development.

                Traditional static/dynamic analyses miss global structural dependencies; sequence models/LLMs capture
                semantics but overlook topology; graph models encode structure yet miss semantics. VulnGraph unifies
                network-theoretic structure with LLM semantics to address these complementary gaps.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                The process begins with code-to-graph transformation, where each source file is converted into Control
                Flow Graphs that capture both syntactic and dependency relationships. Multiple graph encoders (GCN, GAT,
                GraphSAGE, Node2Vec) generate structural embeddings representing the program's topology, while a local
                LLM produces semantic embeddings by interpreting the same code in natural-language form. These
                heterogeneous representations are then projected into a shared latent space, aligning the structural and
                semantic perspectives of the code.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                To fuse both modalities, our method employs a two-way gating mechanism that dynamically balances graph
                and language signals for each sample—emphasizing structural cues for control-flow vulnerabilities and
                semantic cues for logic-level flaws. The model is trained using a joint loss that combines
                classification accuracy, InfoNCE contrastive alignment, and Laplacian regularization to preserve local
                graph smoothness. For interpretability, VulnGraph provides per-relation gating weights and extracts
                top-K salient subgraphs with concise textual rationales, enabling developers to trace and understand
                each vulnerability prediction.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                Our proposed approach achieved significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability across
                multiple benchmarks. On a curated Java vulnerability dataset of over 35,000 code files, it reached
                93.57% accuracy, outperforming GNN-only baselines (85.21%) and LLM-only models (75.76%) by wide margins.
                The proposed two-way gating fusion effectively balanced structural and semantic cues, yielding a
                consistent performance gain of 8-18% across vulnerability classes such as resource leaks, injection
                flaws, and logic errors. Beyond raw metrics, VulnGraph demonstrated strong interpretability—its
                attention-based gating produced saliency subgraphs and natural-language explanations that aligned
                closely with expert annotations.
