            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                Modern software development pipelines face growing challenges in securing large codebases with extensive
                dependencies. Static analysis tools like Bandit are effective at vulnerability detection but suffer from
                high false positives and lack repair capabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can
                suggest fixes but often hallucinate changes and lack self-validation. We present SecureFixAgent, a
                hybrid repair framework integrating Bandit with lightweight local LLMs (&lt;8B parameters) in an
                iterative detect-repair-validate loop. To improve precision, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA-based
                fine-tuning on a diverse, curated dataset spanning multiple Python project domains, mitigating dataset
                bias and reducing unnecessary edits. SecureFixAgent uses Bandit for detection, the LLM for candidate
                fixes with explanations, and Bandit re-validation for verification, all executed locally to preserve
                privacy and reduce cloud reliance. Experiments show SecureFixAgent reduces false positives by 10.8% over
                static analysis, improves fix accuracy by 13.51%, and lowers false positives by 5.46% compared to
                pre-trained LLMs, typically converging within three iterations. Beyond metrics, developer studies rate
                explanation quality 4.5/5, highlighting its value for human trust and adoption. By combining verifiable
                security improvements with transparent rationale in a resource-efficient local framework, SecureFixAgent
                advances trustworthy, automated vulnerability remediation for modern pipelines.

            <h2>Related Work</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                Static analyzers (e.g., Bandit) offer precise rule-based detection but lack automated remediation and
                can yield high false positives. LLM-based repair proposes fixes but often lacks verification and privacy
                guarantees. Prior systems (e.g., APR tools, Copilot) rarely couple repair with rigorous validation loops
                or local, privacy-preserving deployment—gaps that SecureFixAgent addresses by fusing Bandit with local
                LLMs and enforceable re-validation.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                The pipeline: (1) Bandit flags vulnerabilities; (2) a local LLM validates and proposes minimal patches
                with explanations; (3) Bandit re-validates; (4) iterate until convergence or limit. Models (&le;8B) are
                quantized for on-prem deployment; LoRA fine-tuning on curated vulnerable/fixed pairs reduces unnecessary
                edits and improves patch fidelity. Structured prompts yield parseable outputs for CI/CD.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                Across synthetic and real CVE datasets, SecureFixAgent reduces false positives by 10.8% over static
                analysis and improves fix accuracy by 13.51% over pre-trained LLMs, converging in ~3 iterations on
                average. Developer evaluations highlight high explanation quality (4.5/5), supporting human trust and
                adoption in pipelines.
