      <h2>Professional Background</h2>
      <p align="justify">I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at The George Washington
        University, specializing
        in machine intelligence and cognition. My research focuses on agentic AI, large language models (LLMs),
        autonomous vulnerability detection, and intelligent systems‚Äîdriven by the pursuit of secure, explainable, and
        self-directed software solutions.</p>

      <p align="justify">My thesis project, titled <em>AI That Detects, Exploits & Fixes</em>, builds upon earlier work
        on MalCodeAI, a
        dual-stage LLM pipeline designed for language-agnostic vulnerability detection and remediation. This research
        was accepted for publication at the IEEE 26th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI
        2025), reflecting its potential for real-world impact in secure software development.</p>

      <p align="justify">Alongside my academic work, I served as a teaching assistant during my undergraduate studies,
        supporting
        coursework in software testing and mentoring peers in labs and projects. I have co-authored research papers on
        topics such as multimodal sentiment analysis and the Sentient AI Framework, which explores emotionally
        intelligent and ethically aware artificial agents.</p>

      <p align="justify">Outside of research, I have worked as a freelance software developer, delivering end-to-end
        solutions tailored
        to business needs. It involved building a Python-based billing and inventory system for a manufacturing
        firm‚Äîautomating their processes and improving operational efficiency. This real-world experience honed my skills
        in client communication, full-stack development, and project delivery.</p>

      <p align="justify">Earlier in my journey, I led initiatives as the NVIDIA Jetson AI Project Coordinator at
        Navrachana University
        under the Jetson AI Specialist Program. I mentored students on deploying AI models on Jetson Nano devices,
        conducted hands-on workshops in deep learning and computer vision, and guided numerous student projects‚Äîmore
        than five of which were selected by the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute and earned the students official
        certification as NVIDIA Jetson AI Specialists.</p>

      <p align="justify">Altogether, my professional experience bridges theoretical rigor and real-world
        application‚Äîdriven by the
        mission to build autonomous systems that are not only technically sound but also secure and ethically aligned.

      <h2>Personal Journey</h2>
      <p align="justify">My path has been shaped as much by personal discipline as by academic ambition. As a martial
        artist, I hold a
        black belt in karate and earned a gold medal representing India at the International Karate Championship. Years
        of practice instilled in me mental resilience, strategic focus, and composure under pressure‚Äîqualities that
        deeply influence my approach to challenges.</p>

      <p align="justify">Throughout school, I gravitated toward leadership, receiving Student of the Year honors three
        years in a row
        (grades 8-10) and serving in roles such as Junior Sports Leader and Class Representative. These early
        experiences taught me the importance of responsibility, teamwork, and effective communication.</p>

      <p align="justify">My time with AIESEC Baroda's Outgoing Social Sector team exposed me to global development
        programs and
        youth-led social initiatives. Facilitating cross-cultural exchanges broadened my understanding of international
        collaboration, community impact, and the value of working toward a greater good.</p>

      <p align="justify">Each chapter‚Äîfrom the dojo to the classroom to community leadership‚Äîhas added a layer to who I
        am. I believe
        technical work is most impactful when rooted in empathy, discipline, and a drive to contribute meaningfully.
        These values guide the systems I build and the way I engage with the world.</p>
