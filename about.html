        <div class="card">
          <h3>AI Researcher</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            I explore the frontier of reasoning and explainability in Large Language Models (LLMs), Graph Neural
            Networks (GNNs), and Knowledge Graphs. My goal is to design intelligent systems that can reason
            structurally, learn adaptively, and explain their decisions, bridging the symbolic and neural
            representations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Karate Champion</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            A Black Belt and Gold Medalist at the Wado International Karate Championship (2017),
            representing India. Years of training taught me precision, focus, and calm under pressure—qualities that
            mirror my approach to research and mentorship.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Early Leadership</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            From Class Representative to Junior Sports Leader, I learned that leadership is about empathy,
            accountability, and shared purpose. These lessons continue to shape how I guide research teams and mentor
            peers in academic and project settings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>AIESEC Experience</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            With AIESEC Baroda's Outgoing Social Sector team, I coordinated cross-cultural exchange programs that
            fostered youth leadership and social impact—broadening my worldview and reinforcing my belief in globally
            responsible AI.

        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Mentor & Guide</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            As a Graduate Assistant at GWU, former Teaching Assistant at Navrachana University, and NVIDIA Jetson AI
            Project Coordinator, I've mentored over 100 students in AI/ML, big data & analytics, and software
            testing—guiding them in transforming theory into reproducible research, published work, and hands-on
            innovation.

        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Creative Technologist</h3>
          <p align="justify">I enjoy blending logic with creativity—whether designing tools, writing technical content,
            or crafting
            user-centric systems. Innovation, in my opinion, flourishes where structure meets imagination.</p>

      <h2>Professional Background</h2>
      <p align="justify">
        I am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science (Machine Intelligence & Cognition) at The George Washington University
        (GPA 3.95/4.0), where I serve as a Graduate Assistant for Big Data & Analytics (CSCI 4907/6444). My research
        centers on LLM reasoning, graph learning, and explainable AI—developing frameworks that unify symbolic structure
        and neural semantics for interpretable decision-making.
      </p>

      <p align="justify">
        My ongoing thesis, <em>AI That Detects, Exploits & Fixes</em>, advances autonomous vulnerability reasoning
        using multi-agent LLM pipelines. This builds upon prior works including <em>VulnGraph</em> (Complex Networks
        2025),
        <em>MalCodeAI</em> (IEEE IRI 2025), <em>SecureFixAgent</em> (ICMLA 2025), and <em>MLCPD</em> (Hugging Face
        Dataset + arXiv 2025)—each
        addressing reasoning, structure, and scalability in AI systems.
      </p>

      <p align="justify">Alongside my academic work, I served as a teaching assistant during my undergraduate studies,
        supporting
        coursework in software testing and mentoring peers in labs and projects. I have co-authored research papers on
        topics such as multimodal sentiment analysis and the Sentient AI Framework, which explores emotionally
        intelligent and ethically aware artificial agents.</p>

      <p align="justify">Outside of research, I have worked as a freelance software developer, delivering end-to-end
        solutions tailored
        to business needs. It involved building a Python-based billing and inventory system for a manufacturing
        firm—automating their processes and improving operational efficiency. This real-world experience honed my skills
        in client communication, full-stack development, and project delivery.</p>

      <p align="justify">Earlier in my journey, I led initiatives as the NVIDIA Jetson AI Project Coordinator at
        Navrachana University
        under the Jetson AI Specialist Program. I mentored students on deploying AI models on Jetson Nano devices,
        conducted hands-on workshops in deep learning and computer vision, and guided numerous student projects—more
        than five of which were selected by the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute and earned the students official
        certification as NVIDIA Jetson AI Specialists.</p>

      <p align="justify">Collectively, my academic and professional journey aims to bridge graph theory, language
        understanding, and explainable reasoning—building systems that not only perform intelligently but also reason
        transparently.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Personal Journey</h2>
      <p align="justify">My path has been shaped as much by personal discipline as by academic ambition. As a martial
        artist, I hold a
        black belt in karate and earned a gold medal representing India at the International Karate Championship, 2017.
        Years
        of practice instilled in me mental resilience, strategic focus, and composure under pressure—qualities that
        deeply influence my approach to challenges.</p>

      <p align="justify">Throughout school, I gravitated toward leadership, receiving Student of the Year honors three
        years in a row
        (grades 8-10) and serving in roles such as Junior Sports Leader and Class Representative. These early
        experiences taught me the importance of responsibility, teamwork, and effective communication.</p>

      <p align="justify">My time with AIESEC Baroda's Outgoing Social Sector team exposed me to global development
        programs and
        youth-led social initiatives. Facilitating cross-cultural exchanges broadened my understanding of international
        collaboration, community impact, and the value of working toward a greater good.</p>

      <p align="justify">Each chapter—from the dojo to the classroom to community leadership—has added a layer to who I
        am. I believe
        technical work is most impactful when rooted in empathy, discipline, and a drive to contribute meaningfully.
        These values guide the systems I build and the way I engage with the world.</p>
